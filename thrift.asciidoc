Thrift: The Missing Guide

From the http://thrift.apache.org[Thrift website]:
[quote]
Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services development.
It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services
that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby,
Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, and OCaml.

Thrift is clearly abundant in features. What is sorely lacking though is _good_
documentation. This guide is an attempt to fill that hole. But note that this is
a reference guide -- for a step-by-step example on how to use Thrift, refer to
the Thrift tutorial.

Many aspects of the structure and organization of this guide have been borrowed
from the (excellent)
http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/proto.html[Google Protocol
Buffer Language Guide]. I thank the authors of that document.

A link:thrift.pdf[PDF version] is also available.

Generated Code
--------------

This section contains documentation for working with Thrift generated code in
various target languages. We begin by introducing the common concepts that are
used across the board -- these govern how the generated code is structured and
will hopefully help you understand how to use it effectively.
